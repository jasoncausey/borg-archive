# Example dataset

This is an example dataset directory.  In addition to this README file,
it contains the following data files:

* iris.csv : The famous "Iris" dataset, (see <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris>).
* winequality-red.csv : The "red" portion of the "Wine Quality" dataset, (see https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)
* winequality_data-dictionary.csv : The data dictionary for the "Wine Quality" dataset.

The purpose of this directory is to provide some small data that can be used to test 
and experiment with `borg-archive`.
